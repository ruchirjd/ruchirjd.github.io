I am a member of a team involved in development of Bacterial Pesticidal Protein Resource Center <https://camtech-bpp.ifas.ufl.edu>. It is an ongoing project with aims to provide a user friendly, multiplatform information resource for any users wishing to find out more about the rapidly developing field of Bacterial Pesticidal Proteins. It is intended to be a useful resource to which academics, students, regulators and any other interested parties can refer to for a broad spectrum of definitive information regarding the pesticidal proteins, particularly their application to arthropod management.
